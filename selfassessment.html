    Given the interdisciplinary nature of Data Science as well as the rigour of the degree's constituent courses,
    it is vital that students be well versed in programming, basic proability and statistics, and
    linear algebra. To this end, we recommend that students consider using the following courses as a form of self-assessment:

    <ul>


        <li>Linear Algebra -
            <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-frontiers-utaustinx-ut-5-05x-0">
                Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers
            </a>
        </li>


        <li>
            Probability and Statistics -
            <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2">
                Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty
            </a>
        </li>




        <li>
            Programming in Python -

            <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10">
                Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

            </a>
        </li>

    </ul>

    If you can pass the above courses, then you have the requisite knowledge to cope with the courses in the MSc. Data Science
    degree. However, if you are unable to pass the above courses, you may lack the required knowledge necessary to efficiently
    succeed.
