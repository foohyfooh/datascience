    Given the interdisciplinary nature of Data Science as well as the rigour of the degree's constituent courses,
    it is vital that students be well versed in programming, basic proability and statistics, and
    linear algebra. To this end, we recommend that prospective students take the
    <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-readiness-assessment-notredamex-ds101x#!">
        this edX course as a form of self-assessment.
    </a>


    Should you need to reinforce your current understanding of the material tested in the aforementioned course, you can use the following:

    Please note that if you find the self-assessment and/or the following courses difficult, then you may lack
    the requisite background to cope with the courses in the MSc. Data Science degree.
