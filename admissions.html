        <h3>Prerequistes:</h3>

        <li>

            An Lower Seconds Class degree or better (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Statistics, or Mathematics
            <br><h4>OR</h4>

        </li>
        <li>
            An Upper Seconds Class degree in another suitably numerate discipline subject to taking qualifying courses

        </li>

        <li>

            Previous experience in Data Science and/or Statistical Analysis would be an asset

        </li>


    </ul>

    Given the interdisciplinary nature of Data Science as well as the rigour of the degree's constituent courses,
    it is vital that students be well versed in programming, basic proability and statistics, and
    linear algebra. To this end, we recommend that students consider reinforcing their command of these areas
    using the following resources:
