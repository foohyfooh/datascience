        <span style="font-weight: 600 ">Description: </span>This course covers the technologies, protocols and architectures of the Internet. A major focus of this course is the technology and the drive towards Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), web services and ebusiness. To achieve this, we will examine the extensible markup language (XML) and associated technologies as well as JSON and REST based technologies. This is followed by exploring the technology used in web services such as web services description language (WSDL), simple object access protocol (SOAP), universal description, discovery and integration (UDDI). With this background, we will look at the concept of semantic web as well as the technologies that are being used in it. Simultaneously, another aspect of the course will look at Java-script and AJAX (Asynchronous Java-script And XML) that are used to deliver modern web-based and mobile applications. nical skillsets are vital for students seeking to start businesses or engage in scientific research.

        <!--<span style="font-weight: 600 ">Textbook: </span>fun <br>-->
        <span style="font-weight: 600 ">Description: </span>This course is meant to cover the basics methods in computational statistics. Techniques such as bootstrap, jack-knife, MCMC with particular reference to both hierarchical Bayesian and Empirical Bayes will be covered. The theoretical underpinnings of the course will be covered in conjunction with relevant computational aspects. The course will be hands on and practical and will rely heavily on the statistical software R. Matlab will be utilized where there is a need for numerical computations. We will rely on both real data and simulated data for illustrating the main concepts in the course. Datasets from different subject areas will be utilized. The course is the first in a sequence of two computational statistics courses, which can be done separately.

        <span style="font-weight: 600 ">Description: </span>This course is meant to cover the techniques in statistics that are computational in nature that would not have ordinarily been covered by the other courses in the Statistics masters program. The course covers topics such as spatial statistics, advanced Bayesian models and some data mining techniques. Both the theoretical underpinnings of the material and the application through computational aspects will be covered. The course will be hands on and practical and will rely heavily on the statistical software R. Matlab will be utilized where there is a need for numerical computations. We will rely on both real data and simulated data for illustrating the main concepts in the course. Datasets from different subject areas will be utilized.

        <!--<span style="font-weight: 600 ">Textbook: </span>fun <br>-->
        <span style="font-weight: 600 ">Description: </span>This is a course on getting the most out of data. The emphasis will be on hands-on experience, involving case studies with real data and using common statistical packages i.e. R, SPSS and STATA. The course covers, at a very high level, exploratory data analysis, model formulation, goodness of fit testing, and other standard and non-standard statistical procedures, categorical data, generalized linear models, survival analysis, and modern regression methods. Students will be expected to propose a data set of their choice for use as case study material.
